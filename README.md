## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Travis Carter

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the School of Criminal Justice (SCJ) at Michigan State University.  
My research interests are centered on the intersection of crime and policing in communities and the consequences thereof.  
I am a quantitative researcher by nature, and have advanced training in a variety of statistical methods when leveraging time series analysis, structural equation modeling, multi-level modeling, missing data management, and categorical data analysis.  
You can find my directory page here at the [SCJ](https://cj.msu.edu/directory/carter-travis.html).    
Please also check out my [CV](https://github.com/carte475/Welcome/blob/main/CV_RMARKDOWN.pdf)!
