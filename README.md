## ðŸ‘‹ Hello all, Iâ€™m Travis Carter

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the School of Criminal Justice (SCJ) at Michigan State University.  
My research interests are centered on crime trends, policing, and the community context of crime.  
I am a quantitative researcher by nature, and have advanced training in a variety of statistical methods when leveraging time series analysis, structrual equation modeling, missing data management, and categorical data analysis.  
You can find my directory page here at the [SCJ](https://cj.msu.edu/directory/carter-travis.html), which also has my current CV.
